# Roundcube plugin - Keyboard Shortcuts NG

Plugin that enables keyboard shortcuts, and makes associations configurable
by Roundcube admin.



## Installation

Like any normal Roundcube plugin.



## Configuration

Via main Roundcube config file (files in plugin/keyboard_shortcuts_ng/config/ are ignored).

TODO



## TODO

Details that need attention:
- make it actually configurable (two modes - merge and override)
- add support for multiple shortcuts to single action
- when previewpane is empty, 'c' for compose shortcut does not work - 404 because of skins/theme/... src= value
- fix help output to display actual associations


## Legacy

This plugin came to life as an offspring of original
[keyboard_shortcuts](https://github.com/corbosman/keyboard_shortcuts) plugin,
joined by a series of merges of almost all unmerged changes throughout GitHub,
fueled by major refactoring and implementation of configurable key associations.
