# Roundcube plugin - Keyboard Shortcuts NG

TODO



## Legacy

This plugin came to life as an offspring of original
[keyboard_shortcuts](https://github.com/corbosman/keyboard_shortcuts) plugin,
joined by a series of merges of almost all unmerged changes throughout GitHub,
fueled by major refactoring and implementation of configurable key associations.
