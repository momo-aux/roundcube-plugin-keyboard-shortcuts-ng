TODO



## TODO

Details that need attention:
- make it actually configurable (two modes - merge and override)
- fix bug when no message is show in preview pane but focus is on it - shortcuts do not work there
- add support for multiple shortcuts to single action



## Legacy

This plugin came to life as an offspring of original
[keyboard_shortcuts](https://github.com/corbosman/keyboard_shortcuts) plugin,
joined by a series of merges of almost all unmerged changes throughout GitHub,
fueled by major refactoring and implementation of configurable key associations.
