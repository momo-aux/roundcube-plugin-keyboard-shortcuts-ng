# keyboard_shortcuts


This is a deadend fork of original
[keyboard_shortcuts](https://github.com/corbosman/keyboard_shortcuts) Roundcube
plugin repository.

Main intention of this fork was to pick up all unmerged but valid changes across
GitHub before starting with development of next-gen plugin.

Next Generation plugin
[Keyboard Shortcuts NG](https://github.com/teonsystems/roundcube-plugin-keyboard-shortcuts-ng)
can be found [here (code)](https://github.com/teonsystems/roundcube-plugin-keyboard-shortcuts-ng)
and [here (releases)](https://plugins.roundcube.net/packages/teon/keyboard_shortcuts_ng).
